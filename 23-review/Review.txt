Review:

Sudoku.java:
- The purpose of the method submit (lines 199-201) is unclear. It seems like it
  is supposed to do the same thing as checker, in which case it would be repetitive. 

- The checker method (lines 204-207) can also be done in easier ways that don't 
  require changing the arrays into strings. One way is by using 
  Arrays.deepEquals(Object[] a, Object[] a2). If you want to stick to what you've
  learned in class, however, another way is by checking each individual row using 
  Arrays.equals(Object[] a, Object[] a2). Since you have 9 rows, though, the first 
  way appears to be better.

Gui.java:
- Unfinished, but what you are trying to do is clear.
