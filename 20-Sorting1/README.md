Efficiency of the different ways of sorting:

Insertion Sort (isort) 
   The runtime, as discussed in class, will be around n^2.
   The insertion sort appears to be the quickest out of the three ways of 
   sorting used.
   

Selection Sort (ssort)
   Like the insertion sort, the run time will also be around n^2.

Bubble Sort (bsort)
   The bubble sort appears to be the slowest out of the three ways of
   sorting used.
